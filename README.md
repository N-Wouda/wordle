# Wordle helper

The program `wordle.py` is a helper for playing Wordle.
Given a list of correct letters, hints, and earlier guesses, it outputs words that fit the puzzle.
New dictionaries can be added in `dicts/` - currently only Dutch and English are supported.

For usage, run `python wordle.py`, without any arguments.
